		<p><br><a href="https://www.jstor.org/site/catholic-university/tower/?so=item_title_str_asc&searchkey=17627sign-in8724654">The Tower</a> database on JSTOR is the digital archive of the Catholic University of America student newspapers from 1922 to 2sign-in18. This system analysis and usability test aims to assist undergraduate educators incorporate original source materials into lesson plans and learning activities. For context, JSTOR is a nonprofit organization that partners with libraries, museums, and publishers to preserve and provide access to scholarship. Among the 2651 individual collections from institutions worldwide hosted on JSTOR, the Catholic University of America contributes 22 individual collections including The Tower.</p>

		<h3><u>Heuristic Evaluation</u></h3>

		<h4><i>Visibility of System Status</I></h3>
		<p>The system responded quickly to search commands, allowing the users to see a response to inputs almost immediately. Downloading documents was the one area where the system showed some weakness. After clicking the “Download” icon, a blank screen appears that provides no indication of what action is in progress. For undergraduate students, the lack of a loading or progress indicator may cause them to think that their input did not register.</p>

		<h4><i>Match Between System and the Real World</i></h4>
		<p>The site demonstrates a good match between the system and the real world of an undergraduate student. The system uses language that is commonly used in other library or academic websites. For example, the site uses phrases like "Search Within Collection", "Refine Results", and "Search Within Results". This language provides clear, easy to follow prompts to new users. From the perspective of undergraduate education, there are two terms the site uses that might not match the real world language used by college students. Those terms are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Serial</li>
				<li>Primary source</li>
			</ul>
		<p> Undergraduate students may be more accustomed to using words like "newspaper", "magazine", or "journal" rather than "serial" to refer to publications that are issued in successive parts in regular intervals. Freshmen and some sophomores, depending on the types of courses they are taking, may not have been introduced to the distinction between primary and secondary sources. An information or help icon may be useful to give students a better understanding of the types of sources their search has retrieved.</p>  

		<h4><i>User Control and Freedom</i></h4>
		<p>The Tower's user interface is very streamlined and straightforward. This simplicity makes it difficult for users to make complicated mistakes that are difficult to undo. Mistakes are easily corrected by navigating back one page. Overly broad searches can be corrected on the search results page which allows results to be refined by adding additional search terms or by restricting the search results by date. Users can restrict their search to a specific time period by clicking on links at the bottom of the homepage. The site provides spelling suggestions for misspelled search terms, although this function can also produce errors which will be discussed later in this analysis. </p>
	
		<h4><i>Consistency and Standards</i></h4>
		<p>The website is externally consistent with other academic websites such as library websites and other journal archives. Like most academic sites it has a search bar at the top, lists search results in a numbered list, has a column on the left that allows search results to be refined, and a dropdown sort menu that allows search results to be reordered by relevance and date. It also has familiar action icons with recognizable symbols to the right of each result that allow the user to download, save, or generate a citation for the corresponding search result. This setup is internally consistent with the JSTOR collection. Navigation within The Tower collection is the same as navigation within other JSTOR collections.</p>

		<h4><i>Error Prevention</i></h4>
		<p>Error prevention is a weakness in this system. There two areas in which the system either fails to take into account the user's expectations and can lead to a mistake or is designed to make inattentive slips more likely to occur. Those areas are: </p>
			<ol>
				<li><i><b>Correction of spelling errors in a search</b></i>. When the user misspells a search term the system provides suggested spellings as clickable links below the search box. Clicking on suggested spelling link takes the outside of The Tower database and provides a list of results taken from the entire JSTOR archive. The user must retype the correct spelling of the search in the search box in order to retrieve results from The Tower. Undergraduate users are far more likely expect that the clickable link provided to correct a misspelling will lead them to their desired results and far less likely to retype their search term in the search box.</li><br>
				<li><i><b>Search bars for different database are located in close proximity</b></i>. The JSTOR database for the entire JSTOR collection is located above the search bar The Tower collection. The presence of these two search bars makes it easier inattentive users to search the wrong database even though both search bars have some labeling to indicate their purpose.</li>
			</ol>

		<h4><i>Recognition Rather than Recall</i></h4>
		<p>The site is uneven in providing users with recognizable cues to allow smooth navigation. For example, a column on the left side of the numbered search results list provides students with a menu of recognizable categories to filter the results. In some cases, individual search result in the numbered list include snippets from the article containing the search terms, with the search term highlighted. These visual cues disappear once a specific entry is selected. After user clicks on an individual entry in the results list, the system opens a page with a scan of the entire  Tower issue containing the article matching the search.  A column on the left side lets users find the page where the search matches appear but does not take them directly to the match or highlight search terms within the page. Users must either recall the context in which the search term appears to find it on the page or read the full page to find it. Undergraduate students who are used to search results produced by Google will find the lack of recognizable visual cues frustrating.

		<h4><i>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</i></h4>
		<p>The Tower archive is very easy to use because it has very limited content and functions. Accelerators for expert users are not needed because of the limited nature of the site. </p>

		<h4><i>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</i></h4>
		<p>The page embraces a black and white minimalist design aesthetic. The design elements used within the site, such as images of the newspaper or brief paragraphs of text provide valuable information to the user while establishing cohesive brand. There are no elements of design that take away from the main focus of the page, namely to provide a search engine for archived issues of the school newspaper.</p>

		<h4><i>Helps Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</i></h4>
		<p>The system does well with helping users to recognize and recover from errors. When a search returns no results the system provides a message of "No Results Found" and gives the user suggestions on how to modify their search to obtain results. The system also  has a guide to help users formulate better searches.</p>

		<h4><i>Help and Documentation</i></h4>
		<p> There is no help information specific to The Tower database. JSTOR provides extensive search help available by clicking a link located on the bottom portion of The Tower page next to search links that allow users to refine their search by date range. JSTOR also has a Help Center at the bottom of the page that offers users support, gives access to LibGuides, and provides training on research basics.</p>
		<h3><u>Results Summary</u></h3>
		<p>The two main strengths and weaknesses of The Tower are set forth in the following table.  </p>
		
			<table class="center-table"</table>
				<tr>
					<th>Strengths</th>
					<th>Image</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><I><u>User Control and Freedom</u></I> - The Tower’s simple, streamlined interface minimizes user errors and makes them easy to fix with back navigation, search refinements tools, and spelling suggestions.</td>
					<td><Img src="Refine Results.jpg" alt="Refine Results Menu" style="height:250px; width:150px"; text align="center"; border="1px solid #D3D3D3";></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><I><u>Consistency and Standards</u></I> - The site follows a familiar academic website format and mirrors other JSTOR collections with standard search tools like filters, sorting options, and recognizable action icons. This format ensures both external and internal consistency. Action icons are particularly useful for undergraduate students.</td>
					<td><Img src="Action Icons.jpg" alt="Action Icons" style="height:225px; width:350px"; text align="center"; border="1px solid #D3D3D3";></td>
					
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<th>Weaknesses</th>
					<th>Image</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><I><u>Error prevention</u></I> - Spelling correction links and closely placed search bars often mislead users into unintentionally searching the wrong database.</td>
					<td><Img src="Spelling Suggestions.jpg" alt="Spelling Suggestions" style="height:225px; width:350px"; text align="center"; border="1px solid #D3D3D3";></td>
				
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td><I><u>Recognition Rather than Recall</u></I> - Inconsistent navigational cues give users helpful filters and highlighted snippets in results page (shown above) but remove these aids once an item is opened, leaving students to manually locate search terms within full-page scans.</td>
					<td><Img src="Unhighlighted Terms.jpg" alt="Unhighlighted Terms" style="height:225px; width:350px"; text align="center"; border="1px solid #D3D3D3";></td>
			</table>
			<p>The heuristic evaluation found that The Tower interface aligns well with user expectations by offering fast system responses, familiar academic language, and strong consistency with other academic and JSTOR platforms. Its streamlined layout, recognizable icons, and minimalist black-and-white design make navigation intuitive. Errors are easily corrected with simple backtracking and search-refinement options. The inclusion of a clear “No Results Found” messages and providing links to JSTOR’s help resources supports users in recognizing and recovering from errors, even though the database itself is small and would not benefit from advanced shortcuts.<br><br>

The system shows some weaknesses in error prevention and recognition. Spelling-correction links unintentionally take users out of The Tower collection, requiring them to re-enter their search.  The close placement of two separate search bars for JSTOR and The Tower increases the likelihood of searching the wrong database. Once a user click a specific item, helpful visual cues such as highlighted keywords disappear, forcing users to recall where the term appeared or scan full pages of the newspaper. This weakness may frustrate users that are accustomed to other academic databases. Additionally, certain academic terms (e.g., “serial,” “primary source”) may be unfamiliar to undergraduates, and the absence of information or help icons limits opportunities for clarification. These issues suggest that while the interface is clear and generally easy to use, targeted improvements could significantly enhance clarity, prevent errors, and better support undergraduate users.</p>
			
			
		<h2>Part II - Mini Usability Test</h2>	
		
		<h3>Volunteer System Usability Test</h3>

		<p> The subject of my mini usability test was my husband, David, a former undergraduate instructor at the University of Illinois Chicago. I asked David to perform the two tasks keeping in mind the capabilities and experiences of an undergraduate student. My observations of David while he was completing the two tasks are recorded in the Observation Form  that will be attached to my assignment submission, along with his completed survey. 
		<h3>Comparison of Heuristics Evaluation and Volunteer Usability Test</h3>
		<p>The heuristic evaluation identified several areas where the system excelled, including quick search responses, familiar academic language, minimalist design, and straightforward navigation. However, the mini usability test revealed previously unrecognized weaknesses that could impact an undergraduate user. For example, although the heuristics emphasized strong Visibility of System Status for searches, the volunteer repeatedly clicked on the newspaper images because the site did not position the search bar where it was visible and did not clearly indicate that the user was already on the correct page. The usability test also showed a lack of Consistency and Standards, as the site used newspaper images inconsistently as action items. The volunteer clicked on a newspaper image once and received a response, but clicking on the same type of image again resulted in no response.
<br><br>The mini usability test strongly reinforces the weaknesses described in the heuristic evaluation, particularly in Error Prevention and Recognition Rather Than Recall. The volunteer experienced both major error issues predicted by the heuristics:
		<ol>
			<li>clicking the spelling-suggestion link redirected him out of the collection 
			<li>unintentionally using the main JSTOR search bar instead of The Tower search bar also lead him out of the collection
		</ol> 
The frustration the volunteer expressed when forced to read entire newspaper pages without highlighted search terms aligns directly with the heuristic finding that the system requires reliance on memory rather than providing clear visual cues. Overall, the heuristics flagged potential problems like design flaws the made mistakes more likely, limited help information, and limited support for locating information. The usability test showed these problems manifesting repeatedly, ultimately leading the volunteer to describe the himself as experiencing annoyance and frustration, despite appreciating the historical content that the site preserves.
<br><br>

<I><u>Suggestions for Improvement</u></I> - To improve the user experience, the site should make the search bar consistently visible, standardize the functionality of clickable newspaper images, and highlight search terms within articles. The Tower should also redesign elements that lead to mistakes such as clicking on a spelling suggestion and getting results from a different database and having search bars for different collections too close together.
