		<h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
		
		<h3>Visibility of System Status</h3>
		<p>The system responded quickly to search commands, allowing the users to see a response to inputs almost immediately. Downloading documents was the one area where the system showed some weakness. After clicking the “Download” icon, a blank screen appears that provides no indication of what action is in progress. For undergraduate students, the lack of a “loading” or progress indicator may cause them to think that their input did not register.</p>
